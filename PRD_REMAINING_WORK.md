## Next Steps

1. **Implement Task List Component** - This is the highest priority as it's the core feature
2. **Complete Task State Management** - Wire up the NgRx flow for tasks
3. **Add Form Validation** - Ensure data integrity
4. **Implement Filtering** - Critical for usability with many tasks
5. **Add Tests** - At least for critical paths

The application has a solid foundation. The remaining work is primarily implementing the UI components and wiring them to the existing backend services.
