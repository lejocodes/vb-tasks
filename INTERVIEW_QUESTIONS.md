## Evaluation Tips for Interviewers

1. **Don't look for memorized answers** - Look for understanding of concepts
2. **Ask follow-up questions** - Dig deeper into their reasoning
3. **Present variations** - "What if we needed to support 1 million users?"
4. **Assess communication** - Can they explain technical concepts clearly?
5. **Look for trade-off thinking** - There's rarely one right answer
6. **Check for practical experience** - Have they faced similar challenges?
