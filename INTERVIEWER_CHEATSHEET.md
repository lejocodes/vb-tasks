# VB-Tasks Interviewer Cheat Sheet

## Quick Setup (5 mins before interview)
- [ ] Open INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md
- [ ] Open candidate's resume  
- [ ] Have evaluation form ready
- [ ] Test screen sharing
- [ ] Open key files:
  - `TasksController.cs`
  - `auth.effects.ts`
  - `JsonRepository.cs`
  - `dashboard.component.ts`

---

## Interview Flow (75-90 mins)
1. **Intro** (5 min) - Build rapport, explain format
2. **Architecture** (15 min) - Start high-level  
3. **Backend** (25 min) - API â†’ Service â†’ Repository
4. **Frontend** (25 min) - Components â†’ State â†’ Services
5. **Scenarios** (15 min) - Based on their strength
6. **Q&A** (10 min) - Their questions
7. **Close** (5 min) - Next steps

## Key Technical Facts

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Onion Architecture (.NET 9)
- **Frontend**: Standalone Components (Angular 20)
- **State**: NgRx with effects
- **Storage**: JSON files (no DB)
- **Auth**: JWT in localStorage
- **UI**: PrimeNG components

### Important Limitations
- No real-time updates
- File locking for concurrency
- No caching layer
- No user registration UI
- Basic error handling

### Test Credentials
- admin@vbtasks.com / 123456
- john.doe@vbtasks.com / 123456

## Conversation Starters

### Architecture
*"I see we're using Onion Architecture here. Walk me through the layers..."*

### Performance  
*"The dashboard loads all tasks at once. How would you optimize this?"*

### Security
*"JWT tokens are in localStorage. What are the implications?"*

### Scalability
*"We're using JSON files. When would you migrate to a database?"*

## Common Candidate Mistakes

### 1. Over-Engineering
**Mistake**: Suggests microservices for everything  
**Guide**: *"What would be the simplest solution first?"*

### 2. Missing Security Issues
**Mistake**: Doesn't mention XSS with localStorage  
**Prompt**: *"What about browser-based attacks?"*

### 3. No Trade-off Thinking
**Mistake**: Only presents one solution  
**Ask**: *"What are the downsides of that approach?"*

### 4. Ignoring Requirements
**Mistake**: Suggests complex real-time features  
**Remind**: *"Remember, we need to keep it simple"*

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Code
- Share your screen instead
- Use GitHub web interface
- Have backup questions ready

### Running Out of Time
- Skip detailed code reviews
- Focus on architecture/design
- Ask for brief answers

### Candidate Too Quiet
- Ask open-ended questions
- *"Tell me about a similar challenge you've faced"*
- *"What's your first impression of this code?"*

### Candidate Too Verbose
- *"Great point! Let's move to the next topic"*
- Set time expectations upfront
- Guide back to specific questions
